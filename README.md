# Home Service Manager

### Introduction

We recognize there is a need for a scalable communication solution for residents receiving home care solutions and their caregivers. Today, people want to stay in their own home as long as possible without moving into an assisted living facility. This is leading to an increase in the need for homecare services. Residents need to communicate their needs to caregivers, and caregivers need to keep track of the residents needs at a large scale. That is where the Home Service Manger comes in. Many residents donâ€™t need all the available services when they start to receive home care, and their needs change over time. The goals of the home service manager are to allow residents to request alterations to their service quickly and to help caregivers manage many residents efficiently.

### Usage
The application has 3 main stakeholders or users associated with it. These are as follows.
  - Senior
    The end user of this application who will consume the services rolled out by an agency.
  - Administrator
    The user (typically a manager at the agency) who will assign the service requests.
  - Caregiver (CG)
    The user group that will be servicing the requests entered by the seniors and assigned to them by the administrator.

The request flow is initiated by the senior by scheduling a service offered by the agency. This service is next acknowledged by the administrator who either rejects it or assigns it to an available caregiver. The caregiver can now either complete the request or decline it.

Each type of user role is provided with a different home screen for role specific activities. The main activity for a senior is to request services. The admin is responsible for proper assignment of requests apart from maintenance activities. The CG is reponsible for carrying out the requests. The following screens are the role specific screens mentioned above.
